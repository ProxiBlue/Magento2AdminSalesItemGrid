# Magento 2 Admin Sales order View Items Grid filters

## Description

The Order Items view 'grid' is a nromal HTML table, generated by various block and .phtml files.
It does not work like a normal/standard magento grid, so adding filters is not the same way as grids.

Since this 'grid' table loads all items, it is easier to make it a javascript datatable (using https://datatables.net/) and thus allow filters to be added
